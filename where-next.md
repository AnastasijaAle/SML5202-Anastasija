  <p> <b> <em> Martin Durrell (Hammer's German Grammar and Usage) Sixth Edition </b> </em> <br> This is a great grammar book that comes wiht explanations and exercises to everything so acts as a great learning material and covers even harder topics for further learning. </p>
  
  <p> <b> <em> Martin Durrell et al. (Practising German Grammar) Fourth Edition </b> </em>
