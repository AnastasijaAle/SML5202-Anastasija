<h1> Tips and Advice </h1>

<p> The only real advice I am able to give as a learner myself is find what interest <b> YOU </b>. There is no point in sitting around and looking at vocabulary if you are not gong to learn it that way.
  
  <br>
  
 Record yourself reading the vocabulary and the translation and listen to it while you do chores around the house and I promise you that you will learn the vocabulary in no time.
 
 <br>
 
 Another tip I can give is go and speak to your lecturers as they have so many books and reccomendations that they could give you. Easy literature reads that are meant for kids but we all have to start somewhere.
 
 <br>
 
 Last tip I can give is really... <em> <b> ENGAGE. </b> </em> 
 
Try and read that news article in German, watch German news on slow mode, speka to native speakers but do it instead of promising yourself to do it.

Below is a link to slow news and news articles in German.

<h1> Frequently asked Questions </h1>
  
  <p> "Is German hard? " - I would say any languge is hard to learn and especially from scratch so to answer directly, yes, German is a hard langauge to learn.
  
  <br>
  
  "Natives will laugh at me when I speak German." - I have never encountered a native speaker laughing at my German and put it this way, if you are in England and meet a natve German speaker who is an exchange student, they will want your help with Englihs just as much as you want their help with German.
  
  <br>
  
  "Any tricks to learnign the endings of nouns and adjectives?" -  there are some rules but to be really honest, it is still just easier to memorise the table as there are rules but there are too many exceptions to them to remember.
